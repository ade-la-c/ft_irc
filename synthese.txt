FT_IRC
Internet Relay Chat

The project asks us to make a IRC server which is able to communicate with a client

The project is in C++ 98 and the use of some external C functions (listed below) is authorized

External authorized functions :

SOCKET : <sys/socket.h>

	int		socket( int domain, int type, int protocol );

		domain : specifies the domain where the communication will take place (defines).
		type : specifies the semantics of communication (defines).
		protocol : there is usually one default protocol in each type, but the protocol number
			is particular to the communication domain.

	Socket() creates an endpoint for communication and returns a descriptor (int).
	The function returns -1 if there is an error

GETSOCKOPT : <sys/soxket.h>

	int		getsockopt( int socket, int level, int option_name, void *restrict option_value,
						socklen_t *restrict option_len );

		socket : 

	Getsockopt() manipulates the options associated with a socket, options may exist at multiple
	protocol levels; they're always present at the uppermost "socket" level.
	The function returns 0 if successful completion, -1 if there is an error.
